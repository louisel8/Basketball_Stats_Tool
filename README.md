# Basketball Team Stats Tool

Hey friends, this is my second project on my Techdegree journey.
with using the tool in this project, users will be able to overview the team stats,
review the players on team, review the guardians on team, and review each team's own stats.

# Recap

- defined different functions for repeat logics;
- raised exceptions when error inputs occurred;
- used dunder main statement and deep copy function for clearer structure;

It's not an easy journey, keep pushing forward and keep learning!
